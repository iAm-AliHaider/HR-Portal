# User Registration Fixes

## Problem Identified
The user registration system was encountering database errors when attempting to save new users. The error "Database error saving new user" would appear during the registration process, preventing new accounts from being created.

## Root Causes
1. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The API registration endpoint was not providing detailed error information when profile creation failed.
2. **Race Condition**: The timing between auth user creation and profile creation via database trigger was not being properly handled.
3. **Missing Data Validation**: The registration process wasn't checking for existing users before attempting to create new ones.
4. **Inconsistent Error Messages**: Client-side error messages weren't displaying the full details from the server.

## Solutions Implemented

### API Registration Endpoint Enhancements
1. **Added Pre-registration Checks**:
   - Now checks if the email is already registered before attempting registration
   - Provides clear error messages for duplicate accounts

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging for all critical operations
   - Added proper cleanup for orphaned auth users when profile creation fails
   - Increased timeout for database trigger to complete

3. **Better Data Structure**:
   - Added missing `full_name` field to user metadata
   - Improved name parsing to handle different name formats
   - Structured employee record creation with better error handling

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - More detailed error messages in the API response
   - Better console logging for troubleshooting

### Client-Side Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Display**:
   - Updated the register page to show detailed error messages from the API
   - Improved error handling for various registration failure scenarios

### Supabase Client Improvements
1. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added error capturing for signUp operations
   - Added better initialization error handling
   - Added database connection testing utility

## How to Test the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/register` in the application
2. Test the following scenarios:
   - Create a new account with valid information
   - Attempt to create an account with an email that already exists
   - Test with incomplete information
   - Test with mismatched passwords

3. For each test, verify:
   - Error messages are clear and specific
   - Success states work correctly
   - Database records are created appropriately

### Validating the Database Connection
1. Visit `/debug/supabase-test` to run database connection tests
2. Verify that all tests pass, especially:
   - Authentication
   - Database Connection
   - Profiles table access

### Testing Edge Cases
1. Try creating users with special characters in names
2. Test with various role selections
3. Verify employee record creation for users with the employee role
4. Check that full name is properly split into first and last names

## Build Verification
The fix has been verified to build successfully with `npm run build` without introducing any new errors or warnings.

## Future Considerations
1. Implement email verification requirement
2. Add more robust password requirements
3. Consider adding account activation workflow
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
