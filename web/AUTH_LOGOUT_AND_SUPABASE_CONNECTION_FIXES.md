# Authentication Logout and Supabase Connection Fixes

## Sign Out Functionality Fixes

We've implemented comprehensive fixes to resolve sign-out functionality issues:

### 1. Enhanced useAuth.ts signOut Function
- Added timeout protection to prevent Supabase API call hangs
- Implemented proper error handling for all scenarios
- Added comprehensive localStorage cleanup for all auth-related keys
- Added short timeout to ensure all cleanup operations complete before redirect

### 2. Improved logout.tsx Page
- Implemented direct Supabase signOut call as first attempt
- Added proper error handling with error display
- Added timeout-based forced redirect to ensure users don't get stuck

### 3. Enhanced UI Component Logout Functions
- Updated Topbar component with button disabling to prevent multiple clicks
- Added 2-second timeout to force redirect if hook-based signOut doesn't complete
- Added data attribute to logout buttons for easier targeting in JavaScript

## Supabase Connection Testing

We've created a comprehensive Supabase connection testing utility:

### 1. Supabase Test Page (/debug/supabase-test)
- Tests Supabase configuration and initialization
- Verifies authentication connection and session management
- Tests database connection and queries
- Validates specific table access (profiles, employees, departments, jobs, applications)
- Tests user profile retrieval functionality
- Verifies sign-out API functionality

### 2. Debug Navigation
- Added dedicated debug dashboard
- Included direct access to Supabase tests
- Organized debug tools with consistent styling

## How to Use

### Testing Supabase Connections
1. Navigate to `/debug/supabase-test`
2. The tests will run automatically on page load
3. Click "Run Tests" to execute them again
4. Each test displays status, duration, and detailed results

### Verifying Sign Out
1. Test sign-out functionality through the UI
2. If issues persist, check browser console for error messages
3. Access the auth debug page at `/debug/auth` for more detailed testing

## Technical Details

### Sign Out Process
The enhanced sign-out process now follows these steps:
1. Clear local state (user, role)
2. Clear development-mode localStorage keys
3. Call Supabase auth.signOut() with timeout protection
4. Clear all auth-related localStorage keys
5. Force a page reload after a short delay

### Error Handling
- All sign-out functions now have proper error handling
- Users will be redirected to the login page even if errors occur
- Timeout protection prevents hanging during API calls
- Console logging captures any issues for debugging
