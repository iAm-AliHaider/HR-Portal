# React Error Fixes Documentation

## Issue Overview

The debug pages were experiencing the following React errors:

1. **Minified React error #418**
   - Error occurs in component rendering lifecycle
   - Related to hooks order or conditional usage
   - Appears in debug pages when auth state changes

2. **Minified React error #423**
   - Related to updating state on unmounted components
   - Triggered during profile fetching on auth state changes

3. **Profile fetch timeout error**
   - Error in auth process: `Profile fetch in auth change failed: Error: Profile fetch timeout`
   - Caused by aggressive timeout settings in authentication hooks

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Improved Authentication Hook

Created a new file `web/lib/supabase/useAuthFixes.ts` with:
- Safer promise handling that doesn't throw errors during auth state changes
- More graceful timeout management
- Improved error handling for profile fetching
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timeouts

### 2. Added Error Boundary Component

Created `web/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` to:
- Catch and gracefully handle React errors
- Prevent cascading failures in the component tree
- Provide fallback UI when errors occur

### 3. Updated Debug Layout

Modified `web/pages/debug/_layout.tsx` to:
- Use client-side only rendering to prevent hydration errors
- Implement the ErrorBoundary to catch and handle React errors
- Show loading states during authentication

### 4. Fixed Component Props Issues

1. **Switch Component**:
   - Updated props from `checked/onCheckedChange` to `isChecked/onChange` to match Chakra UI props
   - Implemented in `web/pages/debug/config.tsx`

2. **Progress Component**:
   - Fixed usage by wrapping with a div to handle styling instead of direct className prop
   - Implemented in `web/pages/debug/status.tsx`

### 5. Updated Sidebar Component

Modified `web/components/ui/DebugSidebar.tsx` to:
- Use the fixed auth hook instead of the problematic one
- Prevent React errors during authentication state changes

## Key Improvements

1. **More Resilient Authentication**:
   - Graceful handling of network issues
   - Better error management during profile fetching
   - Default fallbacks when data is unavailable

2. **Client-Side Safety**:
   - Prevention of hydration mismatches
   - Proper handling of component lifecycle
   - Safe timeout management

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation when errors occur
   - User-friendly error states
   - Better developer experience with clearer error reporting

## Testing

The fix has been verified through:
- Successful build completion
- Proper component rendering
- Elimination of React errors during authentication state changes

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider refactoring all authentication usage to use the improved hook
2. Add more comprehensive error tracking and reporting
3. Implement additional ErrorBoundaries in critical application paths
4. Add integration tests specifically for authentication flows
