## üîß **Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Connect to Supabase

1. Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project: `tqtwdkobrzzrhrqdxprs`
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script

1. Copy the content from the migration file: `web/supabase/migrations/20250528000000_complete_requirements.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Run the script

This script will:
- Create all required tables if they don't exist
- Set up triggers and functions for user creation
- Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Insert sample data for common entities
- Set up proper relationships between tables

### Step 3: Verify the Schema

1. Copy the content from the verification script: `web/supabase/verify_schema.sql`
2. Paste it into a new SQL Editor tab
3. Run the script to check if all tables, triggers, and data exist

The verification script will show:
- Which tables are present/missing
- Whether triggers are properly configured
- If sample data was inserted correctly
- The status of RLS policies

### Step 4: Configure the Client Application

The application is already configured to use your Supabase instance:

```typescript
// In web/lib/supabase/client.ts
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://tqtwdkobrzzrhrqdxprs.supabase.co'
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InRxdHdka29icnp6cmhycWR4cHJzIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDgyOTU0MTgsImV4cCI6MjA2Mzg3MTQxOH0.xM1V6pUAOIrALa8E1o8Ma8j7csavI2kPjIfS6RPu15s'
```

### Step 5: Test User Authentication

1. Use the test accounts:
   - Admin: `admin@hrportal.com` / `HRPortal2024!`
   - HR Manager: `hr@hrportal.com` / `HRPortal2024!`
   - Manager: `manager@hrportal.com` / `HRPortal2024!`
   - Employee: `employee@hrportal.com` / `HRPortal2024!`
   - Recruiter: `recruiter@hrportal.com` / `HRPortal2024!`

2. Verify that each role has appropriate access to different parts of the application

## üîç **Schema Details**

### Core Tables

1. **profiles**
   - Linked to Supabase Auth users
   - Stores employee information
   - Contains role assignments

2. **departments**
   - Organizational structure
   - Department managers

3. **request_categories & request_types**
   - Categories: Time & Leave, Finance & Benefits, etc.
   - Types: Specific request forms with approval workflows

### Relationships

- **Employee ‚Üí Department**: Many-to-one relationship
- **Employee ‚Üí Manager**: Self-referencing relationship
- **Leave Request ‚Üí Employee**: Many-to-one relationship
- **Application ‚Üí Job**: Many-to-one relationship
- **Request ‚Üí Request Type**: Many-to-one relationship

### Security Model

- **Public Access**: Minimal tables accessible to unauthenticated users
- **Employee Access**: Own profile and related data
- **Manager Access**: Team members' data
- **HR Access**: Most employee data
- **Admin Access**: Full system access

## üîí **Row Level Security (RLS)**

The migration sets up these key security policies:

1. **Profiles Visibility**
   - Basic profile info visible to all authenticated users
   - Sensitive fields restricted by role

2. **Self-Management**
   - Users can view and edit their own data
   - Cannot modify critical fields (role, etc.)

3. **Role-Based Access**
   - HR and Admin can view all profiles
   - Managers can view their team members' data

## üìä **Sample Data**

The migration includes sample data for:

1. **Departments** (8 departments)
2. **Leave Types** (7 types)
3. **Loan Programs** (5 programs)
4. **Meeting Rooms** (7 rooms)
5. **Request Categories** (6 categories)
6. **Request Types** (27 types)

## üö¶ **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

1. **"relation does not exist" errors**
   - Check if the migration script ran completely
   - Verify table existence with `SELECT * FROM check_table_exists('table_name')`

2. **Authentication problems**
   - Verify trigger: `SELECT * FROM check_trigger_exists('on_auth_user_created', 'users')`
   - Check profiles: `SELECT * FROM profiles LIMIT 5`

3. **Missing sample data**
   - Run specific sample data insertion sections from the migration script

4. **Permission denied**
   - Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public'`
   - Verify user role: `SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your_email'`

## üìà **Next Steps**

After implementation:

1. **Custom Data**: Add your organization-specific data
2. **Integration Testing**: Test all modules with the database
3. **Performance Tuning**: Add indexes for frequently queried columns
4. **Backup Strategy**: Set up regular database backups

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

Your implementation is successful when:

- ‚úÖ All tables are created
- ‚úÖ Triggers are functioning
- ‚úÖ Sample data is loaded
- ‚úÖ RLS policies are active
- ‚úÖ Authentication works for all test accounts
- ‚úÖ Each role has appropriate access

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Run the verification script to identify problems
2. Check Supabase logs for SQL errors
3. Verify environment variables in your application
