# Sign-Up Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the sign-up/registration feature for the HR Portal application.

## Implemented Changes

1. **Added Sign-Up Link to Login Page**

   - Added a prominent "Sign up" link below the login form
   - This makes it easy for new users to find the registration page

2. **Added Sign-Up Link to Home Page**

   - Added a "Sign Up" link to the home page navigation links
   - Positioned between "HR Login" and "Dev Entry" links

3. **Verified Registration Page Functionality**

   - The existing registration page (`web/pages/register.tsx`) was already fully implemented
   - The page includes form validation and proper error handling
   - Registration attempts are made through multiple fallback methods:
     - Primary: API endpoint (`/api/auth/register`)
     - Secondary: Direct Supabase registration
     - Tertiary: Emergency registration endpoint (`/api/auth/emergency-register`)

4. **Verified API Endpoints**

   - The registration API endpoint (`/api/auth/register.ts`) is properly implemented
   - The emergency registration endpoint (`/api/auth/emergency-register.ts`) serves as a fallback

5. **Authentication Integration**
   - The registration process is integrated with the Supabase authentication system
   - User profiles are automatically created upon registration
   - Role-based access control is supported through the registration form

## Testing

The implementation was tested by:

1. Building the application to verify no errors in the registration flow
2. Starting the development server to test the user interface
3. Verifying navigation between login and registration pages

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more user-friendly validation messages
2. Implement email verification for new registrations
3. Add a password strength indicator
4. Consider adding social login options
