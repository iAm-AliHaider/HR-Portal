### Option 3: Direct SQL Execution

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Table Creation
After running the migration, verify these tables exist:

SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see all 24+ tables listed above.

### 2. Verify Authentication Integration
```sql
-- Check profiles table has proper auth integration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
```

### 3. Test Row Level Security
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies are active
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = true;
```
