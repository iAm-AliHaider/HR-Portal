# Request Panel System Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the Request Panel system, particularly focused on the Leave/Time-off request forms that were experiencing HTML rendering issues and validation errors.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Infinite Recursion in Profile RLS Policies**
   - Fixed recursive policies in the profiles table that were causing database errors
   - Replaced with non-recursive policies that maintain proper security

2. **Form Schema Structure Issues**
   - Updated request_types table to ensure all request types have properly structured form_schema
   - Added specialized form schemas for different request types (leave, equipment, room booking, loans)

3. **HTML/React Rendering Issues**
   - Fixed nested `<select>` tag issues causing HTML parsing errors
   - Created a proper SelectField component that handles validation correctly

4. **Form Validation Errors**
   - Implemented proper validation for required fields
   - Fixed "leave Type is required" error that occurred even when a value was selected

## Implementation Details

### Database Migrations

   - Removed recursive policies and implemented clear, non-recursive alternatives
   - Added proper RLS policies for request_types and requests tables

2. **Fix Leave Form Migration**
   - Created specialized form schemas for leave-related request types
   - Added missing leave types in the leave_types table
   - Updated form field structures to match frontend expectations

### Frontend Components

1. **SelectField Component**

   - Prevents HTML parsing errors with nested select tags

2. **LeaveRequestForm Component**
   - Implemented a specialized form for leave requests
   - Added proper validation and error handling

3. Calculate business days automatically
4. Handle form submission with proper error handling

## Future Improvements
