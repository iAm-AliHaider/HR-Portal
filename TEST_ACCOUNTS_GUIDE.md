# 🧪 HR Portal Test Accounts & Workflow Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview
Your HR Portal is now fully configured with sample data! Since direct auth user creation is complex in Supabase, you'll need to create test accounts through the signup flow. Here's your complete testing guide.

## 📊 Sample Data Created
✅ **3 Test Job Postings**:
- Senior Software Developer (Engineering, Remote, $80K-$120K)
- HR Manager (Human Resources, New York, $65K-$85K)  
- Marketing Specialist (Marketing, San Francisco, $55K-$75K)

✅ **2 Sample Applications**:
- John Doe → Senior Software Developer
- Jane Smith → HR Manager

## 🔐 How to Create Test Accounts

   - Test the full application workflow

## 🔄 Workflows to Test

### 1. **Public Careers Portal** (No Login Required)
- **URL**: `/careers`
- **Test**: Browse jobs, search/filter, view job details
- **Expected**: All jobs visible, search works, no authentication errors

### 2. **Candidate Application Workflow**
```
Step 1: Browse Jobs → /careers
Step 2: View Job Details → /careers/jobs/[id]
Step 3: Apply → /careers/jobs/[id]/apply
Step 4: Register → /candidate/register  
Step 5: Login → /candidate/login
Step 6: Dashboard → /candidate/dashboard
```

### 3. **HR Portal Authentication & Access**
```
Step 1: Login → /login
Step 2: Dashboard → /dashboard
Step 3: Jobs Management → /jobs
Step 4: Applications → /applications  
Step 5: Recruitment → /recruitment
Step 6: People Management → /people
```

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Test that each role can only access appropriate features:

**Admin Role**: Full access to all modules
**HR Role**: Recruitment, employee management, compliance
**Manager Role**: Team management, leave approvals, reports
**Employee Role**: Personal dashboard, leave requests, training
**Recruiter Role**: Job postings, applications, interviews

### 5. **Database Operations to Test**

#### ✅ Authentication Flow
- [x] User signup creates profile automatically
- [x] Role assignment works correctly
- [x] Login/logout functions properly

#### ✅ Candidate Workflow  
- [x] Job browsing (public access)
- [x] Job applications (authenticated)
- [x] Application tracking
- [x] Profile management

#### ✅ HR Management

## 🚀 Deployment Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Vercel Production Testing  
- Visit your Vercel deployment URL
- Test all workflows in production environment
- Verify Supabase connection works

## 🔧 Database Verification

### Check Sample Data
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Verify jobs were created
SELECT title, department, status FROM jobs;

-- Verify applications exist  
SELECT candidate_name, candidate_email, status FROM applications;

-- Check user profiles
SELECT email, role, first_name, last_name FROM profiles;
```

### Monitor RLS Policies
- Jobs should be visible to anonymous users
- Applications should be insertable by anyone
- Profiles should be viewable by authenticated users

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "relation 'public.users' does not exist"
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed! App now uses `profiles` table correctly

**Issue**: Authentication loops
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed! Middleware allows public access to careers

**Issue**: Database connection errors  
**Solution**: Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

**Issue**: RLS policy blocks data access
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed! Proper policies applied for public/authenticated access

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Supabase connection
npx supabase status

# View database tables
npx supabase inspect db table-sizes

# Check for any database issues
npx supabase inspect db locks
```
