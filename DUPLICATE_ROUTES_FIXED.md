# Duplicate Routes Fixed - HR Application

## Summary
Successfully identified and resolved ALL duplicate route warnings in the Next.js HR application by comparing, merging, and organizing duplicate pages.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Offboarding Route Duplicates ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Two files resolving to `/offboarding` route
- `pages/offboarding.tsx` (898 lines) - Chakra UI-based, simpler structure
- `pages/offboarding/index.tsx` (1368 lines) - More comprehensive with enhanced features

**Resolution:** 
- ✅ Kept the comprehensive `pages/offboarding/index.tsx` content
- ✅ Created new comprehensive `pages/offboarding.tsx` with all features
- ✅ Deleted the old `pages/offboarding/` directory
- ✅ Updated navigation routes in `Sidebar.tsx`

### 2. Training Route Duplicates ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Two files resolving to `/training` route
- `pages/training.tsx` (974 lines) - Full-featured but without authentication/permissions
- `pages/training/index.tsx` (857 lines) - Enhanced with RBAC, authentication, and modern patterns

**Resolution:**
- ✅ **FINAL FIX**: Deleted the older `pages/training.tsx` (974 lines)
