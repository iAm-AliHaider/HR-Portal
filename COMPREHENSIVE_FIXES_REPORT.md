- Integrates with Supabase when available
- Falls back to mock data for development/demo mode
- Sends email notifications on request submission and approval

### 2. Email Service (`/services/emailService.ts`)
- Comprehensive email service implementation
- Supports multiple email templates:
  - Leave request notifications
  - Leave approval notifications
  - Training enrollment confirmations
  - Welcome emails for new employees
  - Generic notifications
- Development mode logs emails instead of sending
- Production mode uses SMTP configuration

### 3. Supabase Client Configuration
- Singleton pattern implementation
- Improved error handling
- Development/production environment detection
- Proper session management

## Facilities Management Implementation

### Features Added:

   - Search and filter functionality
   - Quick booking actions

2. **Equipment Booking Tab**
   - Equipment inventory display
   - Availability tracking
   - Booking history

## Database Connectivity

### Issues Addressed:
1. Supabase client properly configured with fallback handling
2. API endpoints include proper error handling
3. Mock data available when database is unavailable
4. Proper authentication token handling

## Workflow Integration

### Request Panel Workflow:
1. Employee submits request → API endpoint
2. Request saved to database (or mock)
3. Email notification sent to approver
4. Status tracking and updates
5. Notification on approval/rejection

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Consistent Tab Navigation**: All multi-section pages now use tabs with URL query parameters for deep linking
2. **Status Badges**: Consistent color coding across all modules
3. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for async operations
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with fallback options

## Production Readiness

### Environment Configuration Required:
```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@company.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=HR Portal

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Application URL
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema**: Ensure all tables exist in Supabase:
   - requests
   - facilities_bookings
   - equipment_inventory
   - meeting_rooms

2. **API Integration**: Connect remaining mock endpoints to actual database queries

3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all request types and workflows

4. **Performance**: Add caching for frequently accessed data

5. **Security**: Implement proper role-based access control for sensitive operations
